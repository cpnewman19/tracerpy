# tracerpy
A framework for the analysis of environmental tracers in groundwater

tracerpy supports functionality for:
1. Input functions of environmental tracer concentrations in the atmosphere
2. Importing data from USGS laboratories
3. Calculating fractions of modern and pre-modern groundwater based on tritium concentrations
4. Fitting of tracer concentrations to various lumped parameter models
5. Estimating recharge rates based on groundwater age
6. Estimating seasonality of groundwater recharge from stable isotopes
